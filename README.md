DESCRIPTION:
Overview
This is a Verilog implementation of a 8-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU). The ALU performs various arithmetic and logical operations on 8-bit input operands.

Features
- 8-bit input operands
- Supports arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Supports logical operations: AND, OR, XOR, and NOT
- Supports shift operations: left shift, right shift, and rotate
- Configurable operation using a 4-bit opcode

Opcode Table
| Opcode | Operation |
| --- | --- |
| 0000 | Addition |
| 0001 | Subtraction |
| 0010 | Multiplication |
| 0011 | Division |
| 0100 | AND |
| 0101 | OR |
| 0110 | XOR |
| 0111 | NOT |
| 1000 | Left Shift |
| 1001 | Right Shift |
| 1010 | Rotate |

Usage
To use this ALU, simply instantiate the module in your Verilog code and connect the input operands, opcode, and output.
